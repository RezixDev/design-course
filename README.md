I guess it is hard to find a good "Design" Course, because the Styles and Landscape as a whole changes all the time. 

One way to approach WebDesign is to get inspired by Print Media like Magazines (just with more Buttons and Animations on top)

On the othery way new Design Styles arise like Glassmorphism. Or Liquid Glass as Apple calls it:

Just after Neobrutalism, Skeuomorphism and Neumorphism ðŸ˜…

Gestalt principles

The rules of Web are: 
Grid and Alignment (Flex, Grid) - how to order stuff on a Webpage. 
Typography and Hierarchy (Headings, font-weights) - choosing font style accordingly to a given page. Serif and non-serif fonts.
Color Theory -  Color Palettes, how Colors evoke emotion, psychology of Colors, Accessiblity of Colors
Balance - creating Symmetry of Elements, positioning of elements according to Culture (Pages in the West are made differently than in the East, also there is an aspect of RTL and LTR reading)
Whitespace - how much margins and paddings should be used, how much pixels should gaps in grid layours have? How to scale spacings according to device?
Consistency - How to create consistens Layours in a given Style, Form and Color
UX - User Experience, how to develop Pages which don't confuse the users. How to Design Headers, MenÃ¼s, how to create UI Elements that don't need to teach an user how to navigate. An Application should just be, and the User should "just get it" without needing an Guide for it. 

I wouldn't stick to one Tutorial or Course, because one Guide just can't explain all the concepts in Detail. I guess an YouTube Video that is like 1-2 Hours explaining basic Concepts would be a good starter. Just start Wide and explore each Topic into Deep (t-shape learning)

Than i would start creating own pages and Designs and getting the experience what feels right and what could be done better.
Here is something i found which i guess teaches the concepts well:
